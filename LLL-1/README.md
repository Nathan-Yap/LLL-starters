# Please excuse the unintuitive file structure, this project was a bit rushed.

## Please note the following
* The /docs path was not used for this project and is just a test.
* You can find the flowchart backend in mysite/flowchart/views.py along with models.py.
* You can find the html templates in mysite/templates, results.html is the body page.
* You can find the js file with backend calls in mysite/static, along with a css file.
